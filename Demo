First, I had to import a series of python lib 

import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

import numpy as np
import json

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from google.cloud import bigquery
from witwidget.notebook.visualization import WitWidget, WitConfigBuilder

Next, I set up BigQuery using the following lib 

query="""
SELECT
  weight_pounds,
  is_male,
  mother_age,
  plurality,
  gestation_weeks
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE year > 2000
LIMIT 10000
"""
df = bigquery.Client().query(query).to_dataframe()
df.head()

I ran the following queries to see their out comes 
df.describe()
df['is_male'].value_counts()

Then, I reshuffled the data to produce a different set of outcomes 

df = df.dropna()
df = shuffle(df, random_state=2)

data.head()
